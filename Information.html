<p class="font"> There is no camera to creep people out, no button to push, no gesture area to swipe, no glowing LCD screen, no weird arm floating in front of the lens, no speaker, and no microphone (for now).

From the outside, the Vaunt glasses look just like eyeglasses. When you’re wearing them, you see a stream of information on what looks like a screen — but it’s actually being projected onto your retina.

<h1> Phones: </h1>
<p class="font"> Samsung's foldable phone for 2018 is pretty much a done deal.That will depend, for one thing, on what we mean by "foldable." We've seen one Samsung patent application for a handset that bends at the middle so the top of the phone can touch the bottom. Yet it's the second patent application that seems much more likely to become an actual device, one that can open up to become a mini tablet.
A typical smartphone includes highly integrated circuits, a wide array of sensors and processes. But future is anticipating much more than this. Curved screens, virtual mobiles, hologram technology are a few of those innovations which are being awaited.
